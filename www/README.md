## ⚙️ Installation Guide (Last version - PHP 8)

1. Fulfill the above prerequisites on your server.

2. Obtain the project files:
   - Download and unzip the project, or clone it using Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/masterking32/WoWSimpleRegistration
     ```
  
3. Navigate to the `application/config/` directory and rename the file `config.php.sample` to `config.php`.

## 🔧 PHP 7 Version Download

For those requiring PHP 7 support, please use the [last compatible commit for PHP 7](https://github.com/masterking32/WoWSimpleRegistration/tree/32a1e7e6bc31f2ed6ed1d83f64d1ae62aeab9d32). Follow these steps to clone the repository at the specific commit:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/masterking32/WoWSimpleRegistration
cd WoWSimpleRegistration
git checkout 32a1e7e6bc31f2ed6ed1d83f64d1ae62aeab9d32

# 🪛 Debugging

Encountering a blank page can be a common issue, typically indicating a hidden error that needs to be diagnosed. To facilitate troubleshooting, enable `debug_mode` in the configuration file.

Here’s how to enable debug mode:
- Open the `config.php` file.
- Locate the `$config['debug_mode']` parameter.
- Set it to `true` to enable debug mode.

⚠️ **Important: Remember to disable debug mode** once you have resolved the issues. Debug mode should be set to `false` before deploying the website in a production environment or going live. This helps to ensure security and performance are not compromised.
